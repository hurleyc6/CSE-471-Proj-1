# Wavetable
Anthony Rodeman, component owner

Wavetable using unplugged electric guitar samples I recorded.

- Wave playback on demand from the sequencer
- Envelope generation (fade out, as noted on page)
- Pitch
- Attack and Sustain Waves (3 possible attacks, then 1 sustain wave)
- Table Cross-Fade (cross-fading between each phase of wave: attack, sustain, decay)

## Parameters:
- `type`: either "harmonic", "pluck", or "strum" (default "strum") to select attack type

## Example
Horn Solo from *You Can't Always Get What You Want* by the Rolling Stones (from a transcription I did for MUS 178 in the Spring)
